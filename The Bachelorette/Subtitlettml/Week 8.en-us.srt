I woke up the next morning

1389
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:51,179
feeling at peace about it.
- Mm-hmm.

1390
00:57:51,179 --> 00:57:52,329
- And that's exactly
the way I feel.

1391
00:57:52,329 --> 00:57:54,949

But it was a tough week.

1392

- I know.

1394
00:57:58,099 --> 00:57:59,250

- Yeah.

1395

Well, I'm glad
that you're here.

1396
00:58:01,219 --> 00:58:03,030

too.

Like...

1398
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:09,949
Um, I just talked
to Luke and...

1399
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:12,300
I don't know.

1400
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:16,019
Like, he was just
talking about, like,

1401
00:58:16,019 --> 00:58:17,500
just some things that
happened last night,

1402
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:22,380
and what really bothered me
is were y'all, like,

1403
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:25,980
being cordial with each other
and then, like--

1404
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:28,199
then you were ragging
on him later on?

1405
00:58:28,199 --> 00:58:30,869
Did you say that you were
being fake nice to him?

1406
00:58:30,869 --> 00:58:32,050
- I didn't say fake nice.

1407
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,429
I said I was responding to him.

1408
00:58:33,429 --> 00:58:37,119
But I--I told him I was
[bleep] because

1409
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:38,500
I can't sit there,
if someone's talking to me,

1410
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:41,300
I'm not gonna say, "Shut up."
I'm not gonna ignore him.

1411
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:43,130
I'm gonna respond
back to him.

1412
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:45,269
And I responded back to him
very quickly.

1413
00:58:45,269 --> 00:58:46,829
- Like, when I don't
like somebody,

1414
00:58:46,829 --> 00:58:47,880
I just don't like them.

1415
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,079
And they know
I don't like them.

1416
00:58:49,079 --> 00:58:52,980
I don't want somebody to ever,
like, try to be fake.

1417
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:55,119
- I get that.
You're stronger than me

1418
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:57,119
for being able to tell someone
to their face

1419
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:00,050
that you don't like them,
and to me by responding short

1420
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:02,320
is my version of,
"I don't like you."

1421
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:05,869
And I did say that because
I was very, very frustrated

1422
00:59:05,869 --> 00:59:07,050
in the moment.

1423
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:10,730
I've got things that I really
want to tell you.

1424
00:59:10,730 --> 00:59:11,980
Good things.

1425
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:15,119
And it's the Luke P.

1426
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:18,250
And it's not fair
for our relationship.

1427
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:20,579
It's not fair for anyone's
relationship with you.

1428
00:59:20,579 --> 00:59:24,119
And we're all at a point where
we're just frustrated with it.

1429
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:26,269
- Okay.

1430
00:59:26,269 --> 00:59:29,119
I'm sorry that this is, like,
what I needed to talk about.

1431
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:31,150
- Don't--no.
- It's a--it's a hard decision

at this point and like--
