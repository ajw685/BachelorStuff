and...take, like, those guards
down around the heart 'cause,

00:47:57,769 --> 00:48:03,750

myself to open up my heart

1148
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:06,570
for someone since that last
relationship just because

1149
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:09,500
it was--it was--it was like
my biggest form of heartbreak

1150
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,500
that I've ever felt, and I was
like devastated from it.

1151
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,679
And I'm not gonna lie:
it's scary with you

1152
00:48:14,679 --> 00:48:18,420
because, like, honest to God,
from my heart, like,

1153
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:21,519
I've never felt so strongly
for someone so quickly.

1154

And, like...like, I really
am falling for you.

1155
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,530
And it's a scary feeling but
it's such a beautiful feeling

1156
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:33,050
because I've not let
that happen for so long.

1157
00:48:34,329 --> 00:48:36,429
My grandmother,
who I was super close to,

1158
00:48:36,429 --> 00:48:38,269
she always would tell my mom
this saying,

1159
00:48:38,269 --> 00:48:41,179
and then my mom would always
tell me this saying.

1160
00:48:41,179 --> 00:48:45,750
It goes, like...
[speaking Spanish]

1161
00:48:48,619 --> 00:48:53,070
And essentially that means,
"Son, don't worry, don't fret.

1162
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:54,150
"Let the waters run.

1163
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:55,699
"Let the river, you know,
flow as it may

1164
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:58,449
"because what's for you
and what's meant for you

1165
00:48:58,449 --> 00:49:00,670
will never be tarnished
and will always be yours."

1166
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:04,420
And in my mind, it's just,
like, all coming together

1167
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:07,519
and it's, like,
this could be the reason

something that concerns me,
I just want clarity.

why you were upset.

because you want to spend
the rest of your life with me.

feel confident in doing that

like, the bungee jumping thing,

your family?"

1456

1470
01:04:49,570 --> 01:04:53,719
I started speaking on my mind
things I already assumed,

1471
01:04:53,719 --> 01:04:57,550
and I didn't give you a chance
to speak on it first.

have full trust in you

don't even--like, even if I do,

like, stay in your own lane.

1481
01:05:22,429 --> 01:05:24,300
It's like I'm in a hallway.

1482
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:26,079
I don't want to be able
to see through that wall,

1483
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:27,179
you know what I mean?

1484
01:05:27,179 --> 01:05:29,380

I had brought up about,

01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:54,449

and, I guess,

1495
01:05:54,449 --> 01:05:56,400

or something,"

1497

whatsoever.

- But you did say, like, "It
felt like a slap in the face."

1500
01:06:07,579 --> 01:06:09,550
- I don't want to say
you're twisting my words but--

1501
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:10,599
- That you want to be confident

1502

your family.

1503
01:06:12,329 --> 01:06:15,119

too 'cause that's--that's--

1504

misunderstood there.

1505
01:06:16,349 --> 01:06:19,349
That thing,
I didn't--I didn't--

1506
01:06:19,349 --> 01:06:21,280

the bungee jumping thing

1507
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,369

1508

Yes, you were.

talking about that,

1510

1514

from day one,

1515
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:37,469

but I just wanted--

1516

- But, no, you literally said,
"I wanna be confident in that,"

1517
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:42,519
and so--
- If I had said that,

1518

have been misunderstood,

1522

to ever misunderstand me.

has finally been on track.

01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:17,069
- There was a lot more heart in
the two guys that left tonight

1858
01:22:17,069 --> 01:22:18,930
<i> than Luke will ever have.</i>

1859
01:22:21,079 --> 01:22:22,270
<i> - He's just not real.</i>

1860
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:24,300
<i> I just never feel like
 it's ever been real.</i>

1861
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:27,720
Quite frankly, I'm pretty
pissed with the whole thing.

1862
01:22:32,050 --> 01:22:33,180
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What?

1863
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:35,149
- Let's keep each other
level-headed.

1864
01:22:35,149 --> 01:22:36,300
Let's get each other's back.

1865
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:38,430
If we let him get to us,
it's all wasted, right?

1866
01:22:38,430 --> 01:22:40,369
<i> - What do you like about Luke?</i>

1867
01:22:40,369 --> 01:22:43,329
- I'm either falling
in love with Luke

1868
01:22:43,329 --> 01:22:46,300
or Luke is making me go crazy.

1869
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:49,500
<i> I'm not sure which one.</i>

1870
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:51,569
<i> - Next week on
 "The Bachelorette"...</i>

1871
01:22:51,569 --> 01:22:53,279
- Whoo!
[bicycle bell ringing]

1872
01:22:53,279 --> 01:22:54,430
<i> - We are in the Netherlands,</i>

1873
01:22:54,430 --> 01:22:56,420
<i> and I'm falling
 for multiple guys</i>

1874
01:22:56,420 --> 01:22:58,250
<i> in totally different ways.</i>

1875
01:22:58,250 --> 01:22:59,920
- I'm crazy about you.

1876
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,130
both: Whoo!

1877
01:23:01,130 --> 01:23:02,420
<i> - I have
 no doubt in my mind</i>

1878
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:05,350
that we can take the world
on together and make it ours.

1879
01:23:05,350 --> 01:23:06,449
- I love you.

1880
01:23:06,449 --> 01:23:08,500
I'm buzzing off of nothing
but that moment.

1881
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:10,399
<i> - How could I not
 be more confident?</i>

1882
01:23:10,399 --> 01:23:13,130
<i> She's falling in love
 with me for sure.</i>

1883
01:23:13,130 --> 01:23:15,949
[laughs]

1884
01:23:15,949 --> 01:23:17,130
It's like I know.

1885
01:23:17,130 --> 01:23:18,380
- You gave me your word.

1886
01:23:18,380 --> 01:23:20,199
Your "stay in your lane."

1887
01:23:20,199 --> 01:23:21,500
Like, it just,
like, doesn't end.

1888
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:24,350
- I hope you're happy, man.
- He's gone, so guess what.

1889
01:23:24,350 --> 01:23:26,369
One less of us.
It's simple math.

1890
01:23:26,369 --> 01:23:29,119
- You're right, now there's
five guys who can't stand you.

1891
01:23:29,119 --> 01:23:30,449
We have a 5'8" villain.

1892
01:23:30,449 --> 01:23:31,670
<i> - When he's faced with
 something</i>

1893
01:23:31,670 --> 01:23:34,449
<i> that's confronting him,
 the guy explodes.</i>

1894
01:23:34,449 --> 01:23:36,270
- I don't care
what you said to her.

1895
01:23:36,270 --> 01:23:38,449
I've been nothing
but truthful with Hannah,

1896
01:23:38,449 --> 01:23:40,569
and you are not
gonna mess it up!

1897
01:23:40,569 --> 01:23:42,550
- [crying]
I don't know what to do.

1898
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:47,100
<i> I've never been surrounded
 by, like, so much fighting,</i>

1899
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:48,279
and I'm scared.
