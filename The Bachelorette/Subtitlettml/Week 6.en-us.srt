00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,680
at the ceremony and, um, we'll
see what happens with that.

345
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,970
- That says a lot
that I'm still here

346
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,480
even though I didn't get
a rose in the one-on-one.

347
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,529
But, you know,
I'm just excited

348
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:19,420
to make the most
of my time tonight.

349
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,619
<i> - It's a little frustrating</i>

350
00:18:20,619 --> 00:18:22,920
<i> that the guy's
 changing this game once again</i>

351
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,420
<i> and, you know, again,
 it's all about Luke P.,</i>

352
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,650
<i> but we got
 a Rose Ceremony tonight.</i>

353
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,799
<i> You know, two to three people
 are going home.</i>

354
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,799
I gotta be aggressive,
and to be aggressive,

355
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,420
it means that, hey,
like, this another chance

356
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,750
to further a relationship
with Hannah.

357
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,500
- There she is.
- Hey.

358
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,369
- Oh, my gosh.
- Sheesh!

359
00:18:42,369 --> 00:18:44,279
- Hi.

360
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:45,480
- Whoo!

361
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,529
- [giggles]
- You know you look good.

362
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:49,430
- You look fantastic.

363
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,000
- Thank you.
- Wow.

364
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,279
- You all look great.

365
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,650
Um...

366
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,829
this week has been
a really big week for me.

367
00:18:59,829 --> 00:19:05,730
I feel enlightened
and that my eyes are open.

368
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:06,930
I know, like,
with some of you,

369
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:09,480
I've talked about my faith
being important to me.

370
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,599
Um...

371
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:13,680
but it's really been, like,

372
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,269
what I've held onto
this whole time.

373
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,670
Yesterday, the Lord kind
of placed a verse on my heart

374
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,680
that really just
kind of encompasses

375
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,869
how I feel right now

376
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:27,630
and hopeful for from all this,
and it was about

377
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:30,680
"Don't focus on the seen
but on the unseen."

378
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,750
And so I wanna know,
like, what's hard to share

379
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,480
and what makes you you

380
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,829
and your fears
and the hurts that you've had.

381
00:19:42,829 --> 00:19:45,650
I want to have
those conversations,

382
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:49,279
and to do that, I have
to also get that in return

383
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:50,750
and get that back.

384
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:57,680
So cheers to continuing on
in our relationships

385
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:02,250
and being comfortable
in sharing the uncomfortable.

386
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,569
So cheers.
[laughs]

387
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,319
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

388
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:06,549
[glasses clink]

389
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:07,779
- Cheers.

390
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:09,529
- Mind if I grab you
for a moment?

391
00:20:09,529 --> 00:20:11,680
- Yeah, let's go.

392
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,950
<i> Tonight I'm yearning for
 more in these relationships</i>

393
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:20,670
<i> because my husband
 really could be here,</i>

394
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,619
but it has to progress
to get there,

395
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:25,349
and I want it to progress
to get there.

396
00:20:28,579 --> 00:20:30,579
- So how's your night going?
- It's going good.

397
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:32,829
I mean, it just started,
but, like, today more so

398
00:20:32,829 --> 00:20:36,500
it's been, like, really,
like, eye-opening

399
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,970
to, like, what's been
happening, I guess, here.

400
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,720
I just feel like there's
a different, like, feeling

401
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,900
that I'm bringing tonight
to, like, what I want

402
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,700
and, like, what I want to share
so that you guys can.

403
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,980
- It's motivating me
to open up.

404
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,529
It's definitely motivating.
- Well, thank you.

405
00:20:51,529 --> 00:20:52,819
- You know, I appreciate it.

406
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:55,880
And the other night,
um, I had a great time.

407
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,779
I was out of my element
a little bit,

408
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:00,430
and, uh, yeah, never worn
a kilt before either,

409
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,769
so that was, uh...

410
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:03,569
- You looked good.
You did it well.

411
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:04,779
- Normally,
I wear it on Saturdays,

412
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:06,730
but, you know, it's--you know,
it was a different day.

413
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,599
- Yeah, settle for
the middle of the week.

414
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:09,720
- Throw a cog in the wheel
a little bit.

415
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,869
- Yeah.
[laughs]

416
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:13,349
- No, but I really love
what we talked about.

417
00:21:13,349 --> 00:21:15,480
- Mm-hmm.
- Um...

418
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,650
It felt good
to open that up to you.

419
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:21,700
- Yeah, well, I think it's
important for you to know,

420
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,829
and this I know--
there's a lot of distractions

421
00:21:23,829 --> 00:21:27,619
and different emotions that go
into it, but I want you to know

422
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:31,670
that I, like, am really
enjoying getting to know you,

423
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:35,450
and I'm excited
to continue our relationship

424
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,619
and, like,
want to see what that is,

425
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:40,329
and that's not coming from
just, like, saying nice things.

426
00:21:40,329 --> 00:21:41,880
I say it, and I mean it.

427
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,829
- I believe you,
and I want you to know that

428
00:21:43,829 --> 00:21:47,619
when I say I'm here for you,
I want you to believe that too.

429
00:21:47,619 --> 00:21:49,019
Took me a little while
to open up a little bit,

430
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:51,769
but I think we're rolling
pretty steady here now, right?

431
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:54,869
- Yeah, yeah, I think so,
but, like, I wrote a lot

432
00:21:54,869 --> 00:21:56,980
in my journal, like,
what I wanted and the questions

433
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:00,900
that I wanted answered about,
like, your past, your present,

434
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,069
like, what
you're struggling with now

435
00:22:03,069 --> 00:22:06,549
and, like, let you know that
that's what I'm looking for

436
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:08,670
and I can also give.

437
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,750
- I guess that tops off
the bucket now.

438
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,869
It's gonna be flowing, right?
- Yeah.

439
00:22:12,869 --> 00:22:15,619
- I did have a question
for you, though.

440
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:17,470
It's been weighing on me
a little bit.

441
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,619
- Yeah.

442
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:21,900
- You know, I apologize
ahead of it, but, um,

443
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,779
so I know you had
a one-on-one with Luke.

444
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:28,400
- Uh-huh.
- Um, before he left,

445
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,720
I told him,
given what has happened,

446
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,569
to please leave everybody
else's name out of it.

447
00:22:35,569 --> 00:22:36,730
- Mm-hmm.

448
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,569
- And make it about
him and you

449
00:22:39,569 --> 00:22:41,619
and only that.
- Mm-hmm.

450
00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:44,720
- And then when he came back,
I asked him direct in front

451
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,569
of everybody again, "Did you
leave all of us out of it?"

452
00:22:48,569 --> 00:22:49,829
And he said he did.

453
00:22:49,829 --> 00:22:53,380
So I just wanted to see
if he stayed true to his word.

454
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,869
- Yeah, and...

455
00:22:55,869 --> 00:23:00,920
uh...I guess it's important
for me to say, like--

456
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,730
like, I'm aware
that there are feelings

457
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:10,420
about him from everyone,
and I addressed that.

458
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,779
And so he did say Mike's name.

459
00:23:13,779 --> 00:23:20,430
But I do feel like I provoked
a lot in that moment

460
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:23,630
and also asked
about another situation,

461
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:26,769
and he did say Devin and Dylan,

462
00:23:26,769 --> 00:23:29,920
but I think it was just, like,
truly having a conversation

463
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,700
about something, and I
was the one that...asked.

464
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,329
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yeah.

465
00:23:37,329 --> 00:23:39,230
- Truly.

466
00:23:40,579 --> 00:23:42,819
- Sorry.
- No, no worries.

467
00:23:42,819 --> 00:23:45,720
[overlapping chatter, laughter]
- Oh, my gosh!

468
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,480
- My bad. My bad.
- No, no, you're good.

469
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,819
You're good.
- Mind if I steal her away?

470
00:23:48,819 --> 00:23:50,480
- Go ahead, Connor.
- All right.

471
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,769
- [laughs] Sorry.

472
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:52,900
<i> - Right now, Hannah and I</i>

473
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,670
<i> have something really good
 going on</i>

474
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:57,829
and it's frustrating, because
I know Luke P.'s a liar

475
00:23:57,829 --> 00:24:00,049
and I know Luke P.'s
not gonna change,

476
00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:04,450
and I don't want to see Hannah
around somebody like that.

477
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,420
- G, what's up?
- Hey, guys.

478
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,619
- Where the hell have you been?

479
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:08,849
- Yeah, what have you
been doing?

480
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:11,430
- Floating around, man,
floating around.

481
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:16,650
- Luke, yesterday,
I did tell you that make sure

482
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,720
no one else's names
come out of your mouth

483
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,529
when you have your
one-on-one with her,

484
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:23,970
and then when you came back,
I asked you direct

485
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,450
in front of everybody
if anyone's names came out.

486
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,569
- Right.

487
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:31,650
- And she said that there were
situations

488
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:34,700
that you brought up
amongst people in the house,

489
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,819
and it was pretty obvious
who you were talking about.

490
00:24:37,819 --> 00:24:40,549
And so she tried to get
the names out of you,

491
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:44,720
and Mike was a name
that came up.

492
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,019
Um, another situation
was with Dylan and Devin,

493
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:52,680
and I don't know the manner
the names came up, but--

494
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,450
- What did you say?
- So to be--

495
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,349
- What'd you say, buddy?

496
00:24:57,349 --> 00:24:59,599
- Let me put this glass down.

497
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:02,680
So to me--
'Cause I told you guys.

498
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,970
Like, I don't ever
want you guys

499
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,779
to feel like I'm talking
about any of you guys

500
00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:12,529
in a negative way and taking up
my time to talk about you guys.

501
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:14,470
- Dude, what did you say, dude?

502
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,420
Just what did you say?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,

503
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,930
what'd I tell you--
What'd I ask you

504
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,869
before you left?
- Can I finish real quick?

505
00:25:19,869 --> 00:25:21,569
- What'd I ask you
before you left?

506
00:25:21,569 --> 00:25:22,650
- Can you just let me
finish, please?

507
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:23,930
- I asked you not
to mention anybody else.

508
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:26,799
- I will say this: like,
remembering and looking back,

509
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,549
I did bring up Mike's name,

510
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:31,630
just talking about
how the day went yesterday.

511
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,470
I did talk about Devin.

512
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,599
I talked about
the both of you guys.

513
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:35,849
- Mm-hmm.
- I didn't say anything

514
00:25:35,849 --> 00:25:37,680
negative or say anything
about your character,

515
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,250
anything like that.
- Luke, no one believes you.

516
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,329
Nobody believes you.

517
00:25:43,329 --> 00:25:44,700
Nobody believes you!

518
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,750
- Really? Can you just be quiet
and let me finish?

519
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,670
- Nobody believes you, dude.

520
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:50,400
- Connor, I would like
really to talk to you.

521
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,680
I just, like, I'm frustrated.

522
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,380
Just, uh...

[bleep].
So, um,

524
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,529
just give me,
like, a second, okay?

525
00:25:58,529 --> 00:26:01,630
- Yeah. Take your time,
Okay.

526
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:04,430
- Can you guys not understand
where I'm coming from?

527
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,569
- No.

528
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:06,720
- Did you say that you swore

529
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,269
that you didn't say
any of our names?

530
00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:09,000
- No, I never said that.

531
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,799
- You didn't say you swore,
or you said you didn't say--

532
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,819
- No.
- Say anybody's names or--

533
00:26:12,819 --> 00:26:14,450
- Take the word
"swore" out of it,

534
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:15,900

We're all clearing this up,
right?

577
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:54,799
- Yeah, yeah, I just want
to talk about what Garrett--

578
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,049
'Cause this is
the most important thing.

579
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,599
This conversation wasn't even
how all this got brought up.

580
00:27:58,599 --> 00:27:59,829
I was manning up to them

581
00:27:59,829 --> 00:28:01,829
because Garrett had asked me
when I left the house--

582
00:28:01,829 --> 00:28:04,480
or, excuse me, got back
from my one-on-one--

583
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,000
- Both.
- Both. He told me,

584
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,470
"Luke, make sure you don't
talk about any of us,"

585
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,650
and I told him, I was like,

586
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,700
"Look, I did bring up
Mike's name."

587
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,630
I think--I don't know
who all I brought up.

588
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,900
I know I brought up
Dylan and Devin

589
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,869
because of that situation
we just talked about.

590
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:18,900
And I was trying my best
to clear up stuff

591
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,720
that I was trying
to give Hannah clarity.

592
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,529
- Look, I just don't--
Hannah, this is what

593
00:28:22,529 --> 00:28:23,650
I don't understand is...
- Mm-hmm.

594
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:25,700
- When I'm with you,
I'm focused on us, right?

595
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,420
I'm focused
on our relationship.

596
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,869
So what I'm confused by is

597
00:28:28,869 --> 00:28:31,480
when he's spending time
with you on your one-on-one,

598
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,619
I don't understand
how me and Dylan or Mike

599
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:35,470
or anybody else comes up.

600
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,519
- 'Cause I am the one
that asked about it.

601
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:38,869
Going on a one-on-one with him,

602
00:28:38,869 --> 00:28:40,769
I had to clear up what was
happening in the house,

603
00:28:40,769 --> 00:28:41,920
- Of course.
- So that is why

604
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,470
we talked about
other people on our date.

605
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,680
- Of course, that makes sense.

606
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,549
- When I go
on a date with you,

607
00:28:47,549 --> 00:28:49,529
I'm not asking you
what you think about Mike.

608
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:50,819
- Yeah.
- Because I haven't

609
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:52,630
heard anything
that's happening.

610
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,930
But because you all have told
me what you thought about him,

611
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,750
I'm gonna ask about
the certain situations

612
00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:00,630
as to why y'all feel that way,
and so that's what I was doing.

613
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,579
- Yeah.
- I'm not trying to

614
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:03,869
defend him in any way.

615
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:06,529
Like, I'm aware of some
of the [bleep] he's done.

616
00:29:06,529 --> 00:29:08,950
Like, I--and I've said it
to his face.

617
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:13,579
But I'm aware that you
don't like him, okay?

618
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:15,829
And so I'm still trying
to piece it together.

619
00:29:15,829 --> 00:29:18,630
- Gotcha.
- And so I feel bad that

620
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,630
I'm talking about
it one-on-one

621
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,549
right in front of him
to all of you,

622
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:24,599
but I feel like
it's affecting everything,

623
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:26,549
so I'm just
gonna clear the air.

624
00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:28,769
I'm tired of hearing
screaming about something--

625
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:30,980
if you just ask me,
I can tell,

626
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:34,529
because I'm--obviously,
you don't listen to him,

627
00:29:34,529 --> 00:29:36,519
and hopefully you trust me,
and I'll tell you.

628
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:38,670
- Of course we--
I think we all trust you.

629
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:39,869
- So, like, just like with you.

630
00:29:39,869 --> 00:29:41,900
Like, I will tell you
what happened.

631
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,700
And I'm sorry
I just stormed in here,

632
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,750
but I just, like--

633
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:49,670
could hear the yelling
and, like...

634
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:54,400
I want to clear everything up
'cause I'm so frustrated.

635
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,930
- I understand that.

636
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:59,470
- I think everyone got shaken
up because the fact is,

637
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,599
I asked Luke point-blank,

638
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:04,529
and it's not
any of our business

639
00:30:04,529 --> 00:30:05,650
for you to go in detail,

640
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,480
but you said
you didn't say anything.

641
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,549
- Right.
- Period.

642
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:09,980
And that's why
we're all confused.

643
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:13,529
That's why you're getting the
reaction that you're getting,

644
00:30:13,529 --> 00:30:14,849
because--I mean,
what's the point?

645
00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:16,579
I made sure to ask you
before you left

646
00:30:16,579 --> 00:30:18,430
and when you got back
in front of everyone

647
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,730
'cause I wanted
everyone to see.

648
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,450
- Look, the last thing
I want to do

649
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:23,599
is talk about any
of you guys on this date,

650
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:26,650
and to me, in my mind--
And I just manned up

651
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,900
and said, "Look, I didn't tell
the truth to you guys,"

652
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,829
'cause when I got back,
I said I didn't bring up

653
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,420
any of your guys' names,
and that is the truth.

654
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,869
But I was looking at it
from, like,

655
00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:38,569
a Luke S. standpoint
of bringing you guys down,

656
00:30:38,569 --> 00:30:39,930
saying anything negative
about you guys,

657
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:43,450
saying, if--anything, if you're
not here for the right reasons.

658
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,700
- I just don't--
- And I did explain--

659
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,599
Whoa, whoa, let me finish.
- You could've said that, dude.

660
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:49,630
- Hey, I explained--I just
said that to all of you guys.

661
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,849
- You didn't say that then.

662
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,750
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Be real here.

663
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,829
There's haters in the room,

664
00:30:53,829 --> 00:30:55,630
and that's exactly
what I just said to you.

665
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,849
I was explaining situations

666
00:30:57,849 --> 00:31:01,470
'cause there was stuff that
I had to clear up with Hannah.

667
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,180
- Yeah, I get it.

668
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,480
Um...

669
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,849
I wanna continue on
with the night,

frustrated as [bleep].

671
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,400
- 100%.
- Um, so...

672
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,619
the thing
I wanna say to you all is,

673
00:31:17,619 --> 00:31:20,650
stay in your freaking lane,

00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:41,619
so I need to just
pull her aside for a second.

1190
00:57:41,619 --> 00:57:45,579
<i> - Cam had got in his head
 that he was going home,</i>

1191
00:57:45,579 --> 00:57:48,429
that he needed a rose.

1192
00:57:48,429 --> 00:57:49,800
So he needed to basically
his Hail Mary.

1193
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:54,480
- I got a call from my dad that
my grandma had passed away.

1194
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,800
- The pity rose.
- The pity rose.

1195
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,519
- The most recent surgery
that I had

1196
00:57:58,519 --> 00:58:01,429
in November of 2017
hit me the hardest,

1197
00:58:01,429 --> 00:58:02,679
because I actually had

1198
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:04,780
a ten-month-old puppy
at the time

1199
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:07,829
that I was super close to
that I had to rehome.

1200
00:58:07,829 --> 00:58:10,480
- Girl don't give out
pity roses.

1201
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,550
So that--that did not fly
with me.

1202
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:16,699
I just feel like
it's an interesting time

1203
00:58:16,699 --> 00:58:19,800
for you
to bring up this story.

1204
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:24,679
This just feels really schemy
and slimy to me.

1205
00:58:24,679 --> 00:58:28,019
- Why are we giving Cam
so much [bleep] time?

1206
00:58:28,019 --> 00:58:31,099
- We can't have one person just
sap up our day with Hannah.

1207
00:58:31,099 --> 00:58:35,670
- I mean, Hannah knows all the
stuff that Cam's pulled, right?

1208
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:36,719
- Don't get me wrong.

1209
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:39,679
I'm--I'm really thankful
for any guy

1210
00:58:39,679 --> 00:58:42,630
sharing something

1211
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:44,679
really vulnerable with me.
- Right.

1212
00:58:44,679 --> 00:58:47,570
- But do it because you want
to share it with me,

1213
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:52,179
not because you feel like
you have to to save yourself.

1214
00:58:52,179 --> 00:58:52,730
- Right.

1215
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:55,519
Okay, so that brings us
to the guy

1216
00:58:55,519 --> 00:58:57,320
who stirred up the most drama.

1217
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,300
- Okay.

1218
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:00,369
- Luke.
- [laughs]

1219
00:59:00,369 --> 00:59:01,519
Luke P.

1220
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:03,570
- Hannah,

1221
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:07,630
I'm genuinely starting

1222
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:11,269
to fall in love with you.

1223
00:59:11,269 --> 00:59:12,900
[cheers and applause]

1224
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:15,530
<i> - Who, on the very first date
 of the season,</i>

1225
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:17,650
<i> professed his love for you.</i>

1226
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:19,500
<i> But the guys don't love it.</i>

1227
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:20,599
<i> - I understand it, 'cause</i>

1228
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:21,880
<i> I have a relationship
 with him.</i>

1229
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:24,730
<i> But it didn't need to be
 shared with everyone.</i>

1230
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:26,929
[cheers and applause]

1231
00:59:26,929 --> 00:59:31,070
Luke has a tendency to make
group dates like one-on-ones,

1232
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:37,650
and it was starting to affect
me with my other relationships.

1233
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:39,920
- How you doing?
- Good.

1234
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,980
Can I have, like,
just a few more minutes?

1235
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:44,679
We're talking about something.
- You guys almost wrapped up?

1236
00:59:44,679 --> 00:59:45,869
- It's kind of personal, yeah.

1237
00:59:45,869 --> 00:59:48,699
<i> - It puts me
 in a really bad situation,</i>

1238
00:59:48,699 --> 00:59:52,730
and I can feel the tension
from the other guys.

1239
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:54,579
- You put him in check.

1240
00:59:54,579 --> 00:59:56,480
- Well, yeah.
- You put him in his place.

1241
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,699
- I promise I'm gonna
talk to you again.

1242
00:59:58,699 --> 01:00:02,630
But, like, I want to, like,
call my own shots.

1243
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:04,780
He's not the only one here.

1244
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:09,619
And, like, buddy,
slow your roll.

1245
01:00:09,619 --> 01:00:11,820
[cheers and applause]

1246
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:15,619
<i> - And then things really came
 to a head on the rugby date</i>

1247
01:00:15,619 --> 01:00:17,599
<i> in Rhode Island.
</i>- [screams]

1248
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:20,599
<i> - Luke's obviously
 a very competitive guy.</i>

1249
01:00:20,599 --> 01:00:25,750
But Luke S. and Luke P.
made a play.

1250
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:28,480
- Hey!
[men grunting]

1251
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,670
[crowd screams]

1252
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:33,280
<i> - I just saw, like, them
 kind of on the ground.</i>

1253
01:00:35,269 --> 01:00:36,579
- What did he just do?

1254
01:00:36,579 --> 01:00:38,570
<i> - He body slammed Luke S.</i>

1255
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:41,599
<i> and dropped a knee
 on the guy's head?</i>

1256
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,829
- That's really
where I feel like

1257
01:00:42,829 --> 01:00:44,820
everything just started
coming to a head.

1258
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:47,829
- You kneed my partner
in the face while he was down.

1259
01:00:47,829 --> 01:00:49,519
You can't even do that
in the UFC.

1260
01:00:49,519 --> 01:00:51,530
- I did not!
- You, time and time again,

1261
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:52,949
are the issue.
You're unstable.

1262
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:55,869
You are a psychopath.
That's who you are.

1263
01:00:55,869 --> 01:00:57,820
- And at one point
at the Rose Ceremony,

1264
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,869
you're sitting
between the two Lukes

1265
01:01:00,869 --> 01:01:03,570
as they're yelling
at each other.

1266
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:04,929
- The Luke feud.

1267
01:01:04,929 --> 01:01:08,480
- Luke, you made up
a bald-faced lie about me.

1268
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,750
You then go to her
and say that I forced you

1269
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,449
to basically go talk to her.

1270
01:01:12,449 --> 01:01:14,320
- Did you or did you not...

1271
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:14,969
- I said to you...

1272
01:01:14,969 --> 01:01:17,030
- Tell me, "Will you go
talk to Hannah about me?"

1273
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:19,920
- I said, "Go tell her the
truth and say that you lied."

1274
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:23,750
Because it's the truth,
and you are a liar.

1275
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:26,500
- You would think
that they would, like,

1276
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,780
settle down
'cause I'm in the room.

1277
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:29,519
- Right.
- No. Went after it.

1278
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,230
- It was like
you weren't even there.

1279
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:32,500
- It was--

1280
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:33,670
I wasn't there.

1281
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:35,579
But I thought maybe after that,

1282
01:01:35,579 --> 01:01:36,869
like, after Luke S. is gone,

1283
01:01:36,869 --> 01:01:40,500
like, surely,
Scotland, we'll start anew.

1284
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:41,619
And--
[sighs]

1285
01:01:41,619 --> 01:01:43,570
- Man, it didn't.
- No.

1286
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:45,670
- I told Hannah that I thought

1287
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:47,599
Luke wasn't here
for all the right reasons.

1288
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:48,829
- Why did you say
that he wasn't here

1289
01:01:48,829 --> 01:01:50,650
for the right reason,
though?

1290
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:52,369
- You smeared him.
You smeared him.

1291
01:01:52,369 --> 01:01:53,429
- You're a liar.

1292
01:01:53,429 --> 01:01:54,530
- I understand, but--
- No, I'm not.

1293
01:01:54,530 --> 01:01:56,369
- Here's my--
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1294
01:01:56,369 --> 01:01:58,670
Just don't cross the line
anymore.

1295
01:01:58,670 --> 01:02:01,800
<i> - I felt like everything
 was going wrong.</i>

1296
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:04,670
How it just seemed like
the whole house was in--

1297
01:02:04,670 --> 01:02:09,750
like with the drama, and
it really started affecting me.

1298
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:13,570
Hearing you say, like,
you don't, you know,

1299
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:15,519
have any worries
about our relationship;

1300
01:02:15,519 --> 01:02:17,449
I definit--I do.

1301
01:02:17,449 --> 01:02:20,599
Luke, I can't give you this
rose.

1302
01:02:20,599 --> 01:02:23,679
<i> It was like, "How is one guy,
 like, completely</i>

1303
01:02:23,679 --> 01:02:25,780
destroying this for me?"
- Right.

1304
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:30,019
<i> - But I wasn't ready to,
 like, let go.</i>

1305
01:02:31,579 --> 01:02:34,519
- I didn't get a rose.

1306
01:02:34,519 --> 01:02:36,480
But Hannah said she still
wants me to be here.

1307
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:37,750
And I'm still here.

1308
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:40,900
So I'm going into the Rose
Ceremony with you guys.

1309
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:45,550
- And then the cocktail party.
Or attempt.

1310
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:46,780
It just disintegrated.

1311
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:50,650
- I'm not ever going to lie
to your face.

1312
01:02:50,650 --> 01:02:52,519
- Luke, no one believes you.

1313
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:53,980
Nobody believes you.

1314
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:55,880
<i> - Really? Can you just be
 quiet and let me finish?</i>

1315
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:59,880
<i> - My intentions going into
 the night were so pure,</i>

1316
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:03,400
<i> and it all got crushed
 in an instant</i>

1317
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:06,849
by, yet again,
drama in the house.

1318
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:08,719
- I'm admitting
that I did that.

1319
01:03:08,719 --> 01:03:09,800
I'm admitting that.

1320
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,630
- That was just
where I just exploded

1321
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:13,219
and I was just done.

1322
01:03:13,219 --> 01:03:15,420
Stop.

1323
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:16,630
Please stop.

1324
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:20,719
I feel like everybody
thinks it's just Luke

1325
01:03:20,719 --> 01:03:23,320
that makes me feel
freaking psycho

1326
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:25,300
and irritated right now.

1327
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:26,429
It's all of you.

1328
01:03:26,429 --> 01:03:27,900
Stop the focus on him,

1329
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:30,630
'cause I can figure that out
for myself.

1330
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:33,380
None of you know
anything about me

1331
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:35,349
and why I'm here...

1332
01:03:35,349 --> 01:03:36,719
[sniffling]

1333
01:03:36,719 --> 01:03:39,750
And what makes me me and things
that I've gone through.

1334
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:44,500
'Cause all we do is talk about
stupid [bleep].

1335
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:48,429
Like, I'm just, like,
really defeated

1336
01:03:48,429 --> 01:03:50,769
from all of you.

1337
01:03:50,769 --> 01:03:54,429
So, like, I don't want to do
this.

1338
01:03:54,429 --> 01:03:56,429
<i> It was like the--</i>

1339
01:03:56,429 --> 01:03:57,679
the last straw for me.
- Yeah.

1340
01:03:57,679 --> 01:04:00,679
- Like, I just--

1341
01:04:00,679 --> 01:04:03,429
LA, Rhode Island, Scotland.

1342
01:04:03,429 --> 01:04:05,650
Like, I was just can't get
past it.

1343
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:08,550
And I was just done.

1344
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:13,530
If it's--if it continues
to be a...

1345
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:16,530
an obstacle, like...

1346
01:04:16,530 --> 01:04:20,519
I don't see
this working for me.

1347
01:04:20,519 --> 01:04:23,519
But if I can get past this,

1348
01:04:23,519 --> 01:04:27,519
I still have a glimmer of hope.

1349
01:04:27,519 --> 01:04:30,469
<i> [soft music]</i>

1350
01:04:31,849 --> 01:04:34,469
- He has a ring in his pocket
right now.

1351
01:04:34,469 --> 01:04:36,679
He is ready to propose to you.

1352
01:04:36,679 --> 01:04:38,719
<i> Has Hannah reached
 the end of the road?</i>

1353
01:04:38,719 --> 01:04:41,300
He went out and got a ring.

1354
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:42,519
He demanded to see you.

1355
01:04:42,519 --> 01:04:45,250
He is fully convinced
that you are his wife.

1361
01:04:54,650 --> 01:04:57,619
- It really has been
a drama-filled season.

1362
01:04:57,619 --> 01:04:59,619
Yeah, I always say
it's the most dramatic.

1363
01:04:59,619 --> 01:05:02,230
This is the most drama-filled
we've ever had.

1364
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:02,800
- Yeah.

1365
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,480
- But let's move on
from the drama.

1366
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,900
Let's talk about
some good stuff.

1367
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:08,219
Some of your favorite moments,
some of your favorite dates.

1368
01:05:08,219 --> 01:05:08,820
- Yeah.

1369
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:11,179

- [sighs]

1371
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:13,829
So hard.

1372
01:05:13,829 --> 01:05:15,730
I really like
my very first date.

<i> I loved the Mr. Right Pageant.
 - Yeah.</i>

1376
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:23,880

into my world,

1377
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:26,420
but then with
some fabulous drag queens.

1378

- Hello.

01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:14,829
what you wanted
to see right now.

1405
01:06:14,829 --> 01:06:16,519
- Yeah, man.
- It's not what it looks like.

1406
01:06:16,519 --> 01:06:17,579
I promise.

1407
01:06:17,579 --> 01:06:20,579
<i> - It was so bad, so awkward.</i>

1408
01:06:20,579 --> 01:06:22,699
He could have been like,
"Why am I even here?"

1409
01:06:22,699 --> 01:06:23,929
Like, "What was that?"

1410
01:06:23,929 --> 01:06:27,420
But I think he could tell that
it really bothered me.

1411
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:29,000
This is just freakin' weird.

1412
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,369

back in with my pants off.

- [laughs]
Yes.

- Yeah, yeah.
"If we're massaging"...

<i> He made the choice
 to let it go</i>

1417
01:06:38,949 --> 01:06:42,750
so that our relationship could
move forward and progress.

that was going on.

- Yeah.

They can at least say
I feel your pain,

1437
01:07:26,699 --> 01:07:28,400
because they have felt it.

1438
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,670

- Big Mike.

And I love that.

I've learned a lot of things
in my life.

what I want.

I'm really ready.

I'm really, really ready.

I can see myself getting down
on one knee

1462
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:20,550
in a few weeks,
if I'm ever so lucky.

1463

from somebody,

and he definitely
does that.

1470
01:08:35,430 --> 01:08:36,880
- You and Mike connected
in Scotland...

1471
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,529
- Yeah.
- But there were other guys

1472
01:08:38,529 --> 01:08:40,470
that put up a good fight
for you there too.

[laughing]

1480
01:08:51,579 --> 01:08:53,770

doesn't stay in a kilt.

- [laughs]
And so I know.

How's it feel?
- Good.

1484
01:09:00,649 --> 01:09:02,619
You know, I saw you creeping,
so I brought it back

1485

in case you wanted to
take another peek,

1486
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:05,899
you know what I mean?
If there's anything you want

1487
01:09:05,899 --> 01:09:08,020
to see, speak up, you know?
- Okay, okay.

1488
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:10,630
- Another guy you seem to have
chemistry with is Tyler C.

1489
01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:13,569
- Man, that boy
is good-looking.

Luke P. situation
was going down,

01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:28,449
so I was really heavy

1497
01:09:28,449 --> 01:09:30,670
and just needed somebody
to just hold me.

1498
01:09:30,670 --> 01:09:32,880
I know I'm supposed to be here,
but sometimes I'm like

1499
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,630
I don't know why
and if it's gonna work.

1500
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:38,270
- Come here.

1501
01:09:38,270 --> 01:09:39,500
I'm here for you.

that there was so much more

1505

with our relationship
than just physical.

1506
01:09:47,829 --> 01:09:50,779
There are not many people
that could have

1507
01:09:50,779 --> 01:09:54,479
made me feel comforted today.

1508
01:09:54,479 --> 01:09:56,350
I'm thankful for you.

1509
01:09:56,350 --> 01:09:57,520
- I'm glad I could be that guy.

1510
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:58,850
- I don't think that morning

1511
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:01,800
I could have ever imagined
feeling the way I did.

talk about:

Peter.
- Yeah, Peter.

- I'm glad that you're here
too.

1518
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:15,270
- So I had a question.
Now, you, um...

1519
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:15,880
are your bags packed?

1520
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,529
'Cause I got the jet
waiting outside, so--

somewhere warm--I can do that.

1525
01:10:22,699 --> 01:10:25,399
<i> - He kind of snuck up on you.
 - Definitely.</i>

1526
01:10:25,399 --> 01:10:27,770
I just thought Peter was sweet.

1527
01:10:27,770 --> 01:10:30,729
Didn't really know
where he fell in the pack.

1528
01:10:30,729 --> 01:10:33,770
- So I wanted to, like,
officially ask

1529
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:37,300
if you wanted to
be my girlfriend.

1530
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:38,670
I know--
- Oh, my gosh.

1531
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:40,850
- I'll preface it with
I'm okay with you dating,

1532
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:43,529
like, 14 other guys
at the same time.

1533
01:10:43,529 --> 01:10:46,319
- I would love
to be your girlfriend.

1534
01:10:46,319 --> 01:10:47,319
- Would you?
- Yeah.

1535
01:10:47,319 --> 01:10:48,479
- Okay.
- Man.

1536
01:10:48,479 --> 01:10:50,470
<i> - For someone who
 really started off slow,</i>

1537
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:51,670
he's come on strong.
- Yeah.

1538
01:10:51,670 --> 01:10:54,100
Boy, did I see more of him.

1539
01:10:57,380 --> 01:10:58,520
<i> I mean...
 - [laughs]</i>

1540
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,420
Pinned me up against a wall.

1541
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:02,430
- Oh, my God.
- Whoo!

1542
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:04,199
<i> - Good move?</i>

1543
01:11:04,199 --> 01:11:05,399
- Whew!

1544
01:11:05,399 --> 01:11:06,729
Great move.
[laughs]

1545
01:11:06,729 --> 01:11:09,699
- Okay, before you became
the bachelorette,

1546
01:11:09,699 --> 01:11:12,649
you told me you'd only kissed,
like, four or five guys...

1547
01:11:12,649 --> 01:11:13,819
- Five. Yeah.

1548
01:11:13,819 --> 01:11:15,619
- Your entire life.
- Yeah.

1549
01:11:15,619 --> 01:11:16,899
- Really only five guys...

1550
01:11:16,899 --> 01:11:19,270
- Only five.
- Before "The Bachelorette"?

1551
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:19,850
- Promise.

1552
01:11:19,850 --> 01:11:21,470
- You've been
the kissing bandit.

1553
01:11:21,470 --> 01:11:23,479
- [sighs]
- Okay, be honest.

1554
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:25,300
Who's the best kisser?

1555
01:11:28,399 --> 01:11:29,569
It's not that hard
of a question.

1556
01:11:29,569 --> 01:11:33,529
- No, yes, it is,
because they're all different.

1557
01:11:33,529 --> 01:11:34,619
- But who's that one
where you're like,

1558
01:11:34,619 --> 01:11:37,630
"Okay, I could
just make out all day"?

1559
01:11:37,630 --> 01:11:39,420
- Luke.

1560
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:40,729
[laughs]

1561
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:42,850
- Overall, despite some drama,

1562
01:11:42,850 --> 01:11:46,380
you really gotta be happy
with the group of guys

1563
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:48,500
that are here
to win your heart.

1564
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:49,550
- I am.

1565
01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:51,779
I have a heck of
a group of guys.

1566
01:11:51,779 --> 01:11:53,550
- You got your work
cut out for you.

1567
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:55,500
- I definitely have
my work cut out for me.

1568
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,529
And...
[sighs]

1569
01:11:57,529 --> 01:11:58,619
Gah.

1570
01:11:58,619 --> 01:12:00,380
If I survive,
at the end of this,

1571
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:01,529
somebody buy me a drink.

1572
01:12:01,529 --> 01:12:02,880
Could you buy me a drink,
you think?

1573
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,199
- Hopefully you'll have a man
to do that by then.

1574
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:06,399
- Yeah.

1575
01:12:12,479 --> 01:12:13,750
<i> - At the beginning
 of this night,</i>

1576
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:17,470
you were really feeling
that this can't work for you.

1577
01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:18,779
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

1578
01:12:18,779 --> 01:12:21,550
Well, we've seen
a lot of your journey so far.

1579
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:23,380
I want to find out
how you're doing now.

1580
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:24,779
- Okay.

1581
01:12:24,779 --> 01:12:26,779
- But before we do,
let's talk about some moments

1582
01:12:26,779 --> 01:12:30,279
that not everybody's
had a chance to see--

1583
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:31,649
not even you.

1584
01:12:31,649 --> 01:12:35,449
[both mimicking
electric guitars]

1585
01:12:35,449 --> 01:12:37,750
- Then you shred.
Zzz!

1586
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:40,670
Pow, pow, pow!
And then you throw the guitar.

1587
01:12:40,670 --> 01:12:42,579
And you go, "Yeah!"

1588
01:12:42,579 --> 01:12:43,579
- Whoo!
[fabric rips]

1589
01:12:43,579 --> 01:12:44,579
- Oh!
- [laughs] Oh, wow.

1590
01:12:44,579 --> 01:12:46,550
- Did you rip your pants?

1591
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:48,380
Did you really rip 'em?
[gasps] He really--

1592
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:50,130
[both laughing]

1593
01:12:50,130 --> 01:12:50,920
[laughs]

1594
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:52,819
- And that wasn't
the only awkward moment

1595
01:12:52,819 --> 01:12:54,529
the audience
didn't get a chance to see.

1596
01:12:54,529 --> 01:12:55,670
- For sure.

1597
01:12:55,670 --> 01:12:57,199
- You had a date in Boston.

1598
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:58,800
<i> You and Jed are there.</i>

1599
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:02,319
<i> You're excited,
 having some ice cream...</i>

1600
01:13:02,319 --> 01:13:04,420
- Oh, hello.

1601
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:05,670
<i> - And someone shows up.</i>

1602
01:13:05,670 --> 01:13:07,800
- Hi.
- Hi.

1603
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,350
- What's your name?
Penny!

1604
01:13:12,279 --> 01:13:13,279
- Oh.

1605
01:13:13,279 --> 01:13:15,270
- Penny.
- Penny.

1606
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:18,430
- Penny's in heaven right now.

1607
01:13:19,619 --> 01:13:21,329
He's, like, in there,
anywhere I go.

1608
01:13:21,329 --> 01:13:22,520
- [laughs]
- [barks]

1609
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,380
- He went to town on it.

1610
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:27,619
- Yeah, that's awkward.

1611
01:13:27,619 --> 01:13:29,329
- All right.
Bye, Penny.

1612
01:13:29,329 --> 01:13:30,619
- Bye, Penny.
All right.

1613
01:13:30,619 --> 01:13:32,619
- I know, it's too good
to resist.

1614
01:13:32,619 --> 01:13:34,250
- I'm gonna get
back in here now.

1615
01:13:34,250 --> 01:13:35,670
- [laughs]
No!

1616
01:13:35,670 --> 01:13:37,920
- What was
either the most awkward

1617
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:42,630
or the weirdest moment
you had with one of the guys?

1618
01:13:42,630 --> 01:13:44,430
- Oh, God.

1619
01:13:44,430 --> 01:13:45,449
Jonathan.

1620
01:13:45,449 --> 01:13:46,779
- Oh, yeah?
- [laughs]

1621
01:13:46,779 --> 01:13:49,380
He went in for a kiss, and...
- What happened?

1622
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:50,550
- Oh, God, it was so bad.

1623
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:51,720
We were sitting right here.
- Yeah?

1624
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,550
- I'm actually very excited

1625
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:55,699
to share this moment with you,
honestly.

1626
01:13:55,699 --> 01:13:57,550
You know, I'm a man of passion.

1627
01:13:57,550 --> 01:14:00,630
One thing I am very passionate
about is basketball.

1628
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:02,680
I do--
I know.

1629
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:05,550
I do--I mean, I actually
made this myself.

1630
01:14:05,550 --> 01:14:08,569
<i> - He started talking
 about this basketball,</i>

1631
01:14:08,569 --> 01:14:11,529
<i> but I could tell,
 like, he wanted to kiss me.</i>

1632
01:14:11,529 --> 01:14:12,850
- I, uh...

1633
01:14:12,850 --> 01:14:15,300
I'm always willing
to shoot my shot,

1634
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:16,770
and, um...

1635
01:14:16,770 --> 01:14:18,670
I feel like now just might be
my perfect time.

1636
01:14:18,670 --> 01:14:25,380
<i> [light music]</i>

1637
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:26,579
Yeah, so...

1638
01:14:26,579 --> 01:14:29,399
if, uh--if you're willing
to take that chance with me,

1639
01:14:29,399 --> 01:14:30,550
I'd be more than willing
to do that.

1640
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:31,569
- Absolutely.

1641
01:14:31,569 --> 01:14:33,220
- Excellent.

1642
01:14:34,399 --> 01:14:37,180
- So...

1643
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:38,199
[murmurs]

1644
01:14:38,529 --> 01:14:40,420
<i> - He went in for a kiss,</i>

1645
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:42,600
and I kind of side--

1646
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:43,600
- He got cheek?

1647
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,899
- It was so awkward.

1648
01:14:45,899 --> 01:14:48,369
It's very obvious when I want
someone to kiss me.

1649
01:14:48,369 --> 01:14:49,520
- Oh, of course.
Body language.

1650
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:50,729
- I'm leaning in.
- You lean in--yeah, no, it's--

1651
01:14:50,729 --> 01:14:52,420
Read the body language, boys.

1652
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:55,680
If you don't know,
then don't go.

1653
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:57,720
- The ball's in your court.
- Ball's in my court now.

1654
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:59,619
- Ball's in your court, okay?

1655
01:14:59,619 --> 01:15:01,520
Throw right here.

1656
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:02,699
Ooh!
- Oh, I hit your face.

1657
01:15:02,699 --> 01:15:03,869
- That's okay.
It's fine.

1658
01:15:03,869 --> 01:15:05,520
A little kiss will make it
all better.

1659
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:06,699
- [smooches]
- [laughs]

1660
01:15:06,699 --> 01:15:08,680
- It was bad.
Like, I--he walked off,

1661
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:10,520
and I was like,

1662
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:12,350
"Oh, God.
That was bad."

1663
01:15:12,350 --> 01:15:13,800
[both laugh]

1664
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:17,699
- But you had a few unseen
awkward moments yourself.

1665
01:15:17,699 --> 01:15:21,020
You had an unexpected visitor,
night one, here at the mansion.

1666
01:15:21,479 --> 01:15:24,529
His name: Marcus.

1667
01:15:24,529 --> 01:15:26,649
- [laughs]

1668
01:15:26,649 --> 01:15:31,770
I went to go powder my face
and then realized that, uh...

1669
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:35,819
there was this monstrosity
on my cheek

1670
01:15:35,819 --> 01:15:39,229
that just developed overnight.

1671
01:15:39,229 --> 01:15:41,319
And, um...

1672
01:15:41,319 --> 01:15:44,649
Marcus was the name

1673
01:15:44,649 --> 01:15:47,750
I gave my pimple.

1674
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:50,579
- Why did you name
the zit on your face Marcus?

1675
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:53,649
- Going into the first night,

1676
01:15:53,649 --> 01:15:55,569
I don't know
any of these guys' names.

1677
01:15:55,569 --> 01:15:58,449
- Right.
- And I would make up names:

1678
01:15:58,449 --> 01:16:00,699
Jim Bob and Marcus.

1679
01:16:00,699 --> 01:16:03,479
Marcus is like the guy that

1680
01:16:03,479 --> 01:16:05,649
keeps butting in
on the conversations.

1681
01:16:05,649 --> 01:16:07,380
- Right.
Can I steal you for a moment?

1682
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:08,619
- You didn't want to be Marcus.

1683
01:16:08,619 --> 01:16:13,319
And when I started getting
this little friend on my face,

1684
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:14,750
I named it Marcus.

1685
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:16,750
Nobody likes a Marcus.

1686
01:16:16,750 --> 01:16:18,630
Nobody
likes a Marcus.

1687
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:20,630
- But here's the best part
about Marcus.

1688
01:16:20,630 --> 01:16:24,350
'Cause apparently he really got
deep into your heart.

1689
01:16:24,350 --> 01:16:25,479
- Is everybody in here?

1690
01:16:25,479 --> 01:16:28,430
<i> - Because when you
 sent Scott home,</i>

1691
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:30,399
<i> [laughing]
 you called him Marcus.</i>

1692
01:16:30,399 --> 01:16:33,579
- So Marcus
is a piece of [bleep].

1693
01:16:33,579 --> 01:16:36,699
He had a girlfriend back home.

1694
01:16:36,699 --> 01:16:38,250
So, uh--
- Scott?

1695
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:40,579
